# Garv's - TIC TAC TOE (Reliving Old times)
# Run it on a jupyter notebook
# INITIAL THOUGHTS:
# We need
# player marker - player's input
# board
# marker position
# if anybody wins
# if the location is available
# if board is full
# who'll go first
# if it's a tie
# if anybody wins
# play again?
# Put it all in 1 Big giant Code Block.
